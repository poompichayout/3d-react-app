The CFX artery and marginal branches are foreshortened and overlapped, although the posterolateral and posterior descending branches of left-dominant circulation are displayed clearly. Deep inspiration, which moves the density of the diaphragm down and out of the field, is helpful. The LAO angle (>30 degrees) should be set so that the LAD artery course is parallel to the spine and stays in the “lucent wedge” bordered by the spine on the medial edge and the curve of the diaphragm. Cranial angulation tilts the LMCA down and permits a view of the LAD/CFX bifurcation. LAO-cranial angulation that is too steep or inspiration that is too shallow produces considerable overlapping with the diaphragm and liver, degrading the image."
